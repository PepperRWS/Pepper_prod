# README Quiz KR8 #

## Intro
The KR8 quiz is designed to have interaction with people in a quiz format. Pepper will ask a few questions about KR8 and we have to guess the right answer. The questions and answers are predifened and can be found in rws\_leanquiz.json.

Pepper uses webpages to show information on the screen. These webpages can be found in the html folder. The lean quiz app uses two modules to show all the information on the screen, namely:

1. Menu: to show the question with buttons displaying the answer
2. Display\_Data: to show a webpage with only images and text (no buttons)
